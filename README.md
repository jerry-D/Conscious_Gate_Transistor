# Conscious_Gate_Transistor
July 20, 2020--The OpenSCAD source in this repositor will generate a 3D model of the bifurcated carbon nanotube transistor depicted in the .png image file.
A provisional patent application was filed today.  As soon as I receive the official receipt, I publish a copy of the application here.
