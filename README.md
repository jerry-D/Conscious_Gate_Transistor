# Conscious_Gate_Transistor
August 5, 2020--The OpenSCAD source in this repository will generate a 3D model of the bifurcated carbon nanotube transistor depicted in the .png image file.
A true and correct copy of the provisional patent application, along with list of References used in the research, can be found within this repository.

A 56-minute "sizzle-reel" video showing remote viewers describing various aspects of the invention can be viewed on YouTube at the following link.  The video comprises (4) 12-15 minute segments from (4) different remote viewing sessions lasting roughtly 1.5 hrs each.  For those unfamiliar with the "military-style" CRV protocol and terminology, a copy of the declassified CRV training manual is included in this repository for your reference.
