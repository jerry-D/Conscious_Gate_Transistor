October 24, 2020--Video of Apollo 16 EVA-3 "Shipwreck" published on YouTube.  The "ship" is most likely cybernetic conscious machine, meaning both biological and mechanical in nature, in that back then, the microprocessor had not been invented yet, meaning it was created at least in part with genetics, i.e., DNA.

To watch the 4.8-minute video, click on the thumb below.  A copy of the official NASA image AS16-116-18603HR.jpg is available in this repository.  A copy of the re-constructed version is also available here for free download.  To re-construt the main feature, a screen-capture of the official NASA video was cropped, stripped, and tone-adjusted before pasting it over NASA obfuscation attempt in said main feature.  Other than that, no other modifications other that re-saturation, constrast/tone adjustments were made to the official NASA image.  Most of the white burn-in spots are a result of NASA airbrushing over other features, such as cables and conduits, etc., littering the site.

September 28, 2020--"ThoughtChip" poster now available for free download.  Click on the thumbnail image below.

August 5, 2020--The OpenSCAD source in this repository will generate a 3D model of the bifurcated carbon nanotube transistor depicted in the .png image file.
A true and correct copy of the provisional patent application, along with list of References used in the research, can be found within this repository.

A 56-minute "sizzle-reel" video showing remote viewers describing various aspects of the invention can be viewed on YouTube at the following link.  The video comprises (4) 12-15 minute segments from (4) different remote viewing sessions lasting roughtly 1.5 hrs each.  For those unfamiliar with the "military-style" CRV protocol and terminology, a copy of the declassified CRV training manual is included in this repository for your reference.
