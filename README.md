Nov. 19, 2021--Below is a "mock-up" rendering showing that you can stack-mount a piece of silicon substrate on top of a decapped Analog Devices AD8229HDZ instrumentation amplifier.  Once mounted, polish with FIB.  Use FIB to excavate assembly jig trenches.  FIB contacts and bonding pads in titanium, gold or nickle--symmetric.  If you use (9,9) trunk and (6,6) "L", or (12,12) trunk and (6,6) "L", you won't need to FIB fields.  Have fun.

September 28, 2020--"ThoughtChip" poster now available for free download.  Click on the thumbnail image below.

August 5, 2020--The OpenSCAD source in this repository will generate a 3D model of the bifurcated carbon nanotube transistor depicted in the .png image file.
A true and correct copy of the provisional patent application, along with list of References used in the research, can be found within this repository.

A 56-minute "sizzle-reel" video showing remote viewers describing various aspects of the invention can be viewed on YouTube at the following link.  The video comprises (4) 12-15 minute segments from (4) different remote viewing sessions lasting roughtly 1.5 hrs each.  For those unfamiliar with the "military-style" CRV protocol and terminology, a copy of the declassified CRV training manual is included in this repository for your reference.
